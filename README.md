# DesertBusMode7

In 1995 the magicians Penn and Teller wanted to create a video game. It didn't end up releasing but one of the minigames contained
in it became quite notorious anyway. In Desert Bus, you drive through a road in the desert for 8 hours of real time, with very little
to keep you engaged. The bus slowly drifts off to the side, so you have to constantly pay attention in order to avoid going offroad
and getting towed back to the beginning. It's commonly called one of the worst games of all time, so of course I had to remake it.

One problem, we had to do our final projects in windows forms, and that wasn't exactly the 3D engine I was hoping to use. But then I thought,
"The SNES had kinda 3D graphics despite not being truly 3D, so how did it do it?" And oh boy was that a nightmare to try and get working, but
eventually we got here. After that, I decided to use all art assets from Super Mario Kart, since I used the same technique that game used to
do 3D graphics. So here's Super Desert Kart in all its glory. Below are the controls for the Map Viewer mode, which I included because the
code was too cool to just use it to drive in a straight line for 8 hours.

Up = Forward
Down = Back
Left = Turn Left
Right = Turn Right
W = Ascend
S = Descend

E and D are hard to explain, but they add a curvature to the world, try it out to see how that works.
